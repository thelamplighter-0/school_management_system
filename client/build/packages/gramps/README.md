[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/gramps)](https://hex.pm/packages/gramps)
[![Hex Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/hex-docs-ffaff3)](https://hexdocs.pm/gramps/)

Some helper data types and functions for WebSockets.

Used in [stratus](https://github.com/rawhat/stratus) and [mist](https://github.com/rawhat/mist) as well.

I will document this more, and am definitely open to adding / reshaping this to
fit the needs of other packages!

## Installation

```sh
gleam add gramps
```

Its documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/gramps>.
